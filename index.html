                <li>
                    <h3>Decoupling and self-normalization:</h3>
                    <p> With the help of Prof. Victor H. de la Peña and Haolin Zou, I am designing and formulating the following course slides, the topics of which are decoupling, self-normalization, (concentration) inequalities, and their corresponding applications in stochastic analysis, optimization, and machine learning. Those notes serve primarily as the course materials for a tutorial at the Artificial Intelligence Institute for Advances in Optimization (AI4OPT), Georgia Institute of Technology. </p>
